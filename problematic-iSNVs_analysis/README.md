## Suspicious iSNV Mutations Analysis
This repository contains the code and results for identifying and analyzing suspicious intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data. 
The primary goal of this project is to distinguish between true biological variants and potential sequencing artifacts by exploring patterns of recurrent iSNVs across multiple samples.

The final recurrent mutation report is available at suspicious_mutations_summary.tsv
