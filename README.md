## Suspicious iSNV Mutations Analysis
This repository contains the code and results for identifying and analyzing suspicious intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) in SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data. The primary goal of this project is to distinguish between true biological variants and potential sequencing artifacts by exploring patterns of recurrent iSNVs across multiple samples.
